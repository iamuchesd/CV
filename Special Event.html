    <p><h3>
    <em>1... 2... 3 is the number.</em>
    <br>We're three months now, yet after all this time, you still float my boat. I'm so thankful we survived. I'm certain no one else could've put up with my shenanigans and your awesomeness. Although you are the only one I want to annoy for the rest of my life 😉.
    <br>The days between April 6th and today were a little bit tough on us, but we held on, same way we've been growing and developing together since February 6th. I've never been so confident to say I'd rather go through hell by your side than go to heaven all alone or worse, with someone else (although we won't be going through literal hell yunno 😂).
    <br>Every second I'm with you, I feel complete, and when you embrace me, I feel our souls become one. I will never stop loving you. You know, sometimes I look at you and think... <em>"Damn, I am one lucky man!"</em> I just can't wait for our first anniversary so that I'll stop counting the months and start counting the years 😏, then the decades, all the way to the century.
    <br>Maybe you might be wondering how different just these three months are compared to the years we've been friends, but I feel only I understand how it's doing me. I hope you feel the same too, because as for me, even in the next months and years, I'll want no one else.
    <br>Yes, my love, I'll go for you again and again.
    <br>Happy 3rd Monthiversary Mami 🤗.
